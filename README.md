## Project Overview
In this project we will be developing a 2D game which will be built using Java. Named PANZER2017, the game is going to be based on the old  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opoib-Q_UGw">TANK 1990</a> arcade game.The game starts with the top view of the map and tanks. Tanks will move in four directions, up, down, right and left. Tanks' first position will be generated randomly. The main purpose of this game is to protect the castle from getting destroyed by the enemies. If castle is shot by an enemy, the game ends and the enemy wins.   Enemy's and user's tanks will be different in colour. The user, may move his/her tank all around the map and can shoot missiles as well. The user gains points based on enemy tanks destroyed throughout the game.If the user manages to destroy all of the enemies, stage will be cleared. The player loses the game if shot by an enemy's tank three times.
