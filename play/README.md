GAMEPLAY VIDEO PREVIEW : [https://youtu.be/oAYIy5GiPjw] 

PANZER2017 SETUP

The setup will install the game in your computer and will add a desktop shortcut as well. The setup works just like any other setup you are used to when installing games. 

Notice that you have to select the "Install anyway" option on the windows prompt(or select More Info > Run Anyway on Windows 10  ). Surely, since I was not willing to pay extra 100 dollars just to sign the executable, windows will ask for your permission. 

Setup has a password. Password can be found by a friendly email sent at ndricimrr@gmail.com. I'll reply the password instantly. Could put the password here but I need some appreciation for the 3 month work ;). Sth like "Hey, I liked your game from Github. Could you give me the password :D" 
************************************************************************************************************************************
NOTES:
In one scenario the game could crash (Extremely rare). This will most probably be because the Setup works for jre versions 1.8.0_111 until 1.8.0_162 and your PC has another version or no version at all (Extremely rare). You can download that on Oracle's website [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html] under Java SE Runtime Environment 8u152, namely jre-8u152-windows-x64.exe supposing you are most probably running on a Windows X64

P.S Many people failed to pass level 3 ;)
